# Thermal modelling, analysis and design of an Integrated Modular Motor Drive Application
The aim of the project is to obtain a thermal model of an integrated modular motor drive having different heat sources, analyze the thermal behavior of individual parts. A natural cooled heatsink is developed for the system. FEA and Steady-State Lumped Parameter analysis are implemented.
